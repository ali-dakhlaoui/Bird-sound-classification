# Bird-sound-classification

In this project, we will be using the BirdClef 2022 dataset, which contains metadata for audio recordings. The are two major steps in this paper, first to prepare the data for CNN models using different audio pre-processing techniques. The second step is to train state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN models to classify our obtained dataset. Transfer learning involves using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on one task and adapting them to perform well on another task. This approach conserves resources, as the model can be partially reused, with options ranging from completely retraining the network to retraining only specific components of it that are related to classification. The following are the key aspects of our contribution:

• Utilization of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for sound classification through transfer
learning.
• Implementation of techniques for sound representation and feature extraction to input sound descriptions into
the retrained CNNs.
• Assessment of the effectiveness of transfer learning on selected CNNs in terms of classification accuracy metric
